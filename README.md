# MIT RailSim Documentation

Discover the power of simulating urban heavy rail transit with MIT RailSim. This repository houses the comprehensive documentation for the MIT RailSim package, a cutting-edge tool developed by the renowned MIT Transit Lab.

While the full package may not be open-sourced in the near future due to funding commitments and university copyrights, this documentation provides a valuable opportunity to explore and understand the capabilities of MIT RailSim. Built upon decades of research at the MIT Transit Lab, this simulation model offers unparalleled insights into the complex dynamics of urban rail systems.

Whether you're a transportation planner, researcher, or simply curious about the inner workings of transit networks, the MIT RailSim documentation is your gateway to understanding the state-of-the-art in rail simulation. Dive into the detailed guides, explore the API reference, and learn how to harness the power of MIT RailSim for your own projects.

## Key Documentation Files

The complete documentation is available as a PDF file: [MIT RailSim Documentation](_build/latex/mitrailsim.pdf).

An online version is also available through Github Pages at [myousefi.github.io/mit-rail-sim-docs/](https://myousefi.github.io/mit-rail-sim-docs/).
